Predict where corporate meetings are likely to start

COVID-19 has affected every sector across the globe, and the hotel industry is among the hardest hit. 
HRS which caters mainly to corporate clients is facing challenges in generating revenue due to the cancellation of corporate meetings because of Covid containment rules. 
2020 PROMAX Europe conference - Madrid, Spain - 500 attendees, 300 hotel rooms and £400,000 ($524,000) cost - was put on hold. 
A conference held in Edinburgh in February, 2020 resulted in 25 attendees contracting the coronavirus.
How can HRS track the green zones, where the recovery rate is likely to go up?
Based on past and new corporate behaviour could we infer what locations and which type of meetings will restart first? 
How to gain insights and information from event data?

Steps for solution:
Calculate COVID recovery rate against each country.
Feature selection on booking data.
Combine booking data and COVID recovery rate against country.
Predictive analytics on countries to recover and have appropriate booking data.
Scrape and map offline events for top countries identified above.
